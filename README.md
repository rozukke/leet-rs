This repository contains solutions to the NeetCode subset of LeetCode problems, split into folders according to the roadmap. The solutions are written by me to be of high quality according to my own standards.

Also included is a Nix flake to make setting up the dev environment easy, and a `main.rs` you can use as your own workspace.

## Planned features
- Comments for certain decisions
- Comments above each solution explaining time complexity
